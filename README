Introduction

MobiLogo is a LOGO interpreter for mobile phones.  The project includes ports to several
popular mobile phones and smart phones.  Currently, MobiLogo works on the following devices:

CLDC 1.0/MIDP 2.0 phones (J2ME)
CLDC 1.0/MIDP 2.0 with LWUIT
BlackBerry Pearl/Curve and newer devices



Installation

Prerequisites:
You will need to install the following toolkits and packages to build MobiLogo:

To work on the MIDP version, install the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit (WTK):
http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/download.html


If you want to work on the BlackBerry version, install the BlackBerry JDE:

If you want to rebuild the scanner/lexer, install JFlex:

Eclipse

Development for MobiLogo is primarily done in Eclipse.  The following are additional
prerequisites needed for MobiLogo:

Install the EclipseME toolkit:

http://eclipseme.org/

You can install EclipseME by entering the update manager URL in Eclipse.



To make development and porting to new devices easier, the source code was split into
several directories, along with a main directory containing code common to all devices.
In Eclipse, each port is opened as a separate project.  Before you begin development in
Eclipse, first make sure you have the required prerequisites installed (at least the WTK
or BlackBerry JDE).  Next you will need to create several path variables that points
to where you unpacked the MobiLogo source code.


To create a path variable in Eclipse, Click on Window -> Preferences.
Then expand General->Workspace->Linked Resources

First, we're going to point to the main directory.  Click New to create a new variable.
The variable name is MOBILOGO_MAIN,
If you extracted mobilogo to the /workspace directory, the path would be:

/workspace/mobilogo


If you are on Windows, the path would be:

C:\workspace\mobilogo

Or wherever you put the mobilogo project.



Finally, we want to import the projects.  

File->Import
Existing Projects into workspace

For the root directory, choose the mobilogo directory.  Then select the projects you
want to import.



Using SVN:

First, install the subversion tools for Eclipse:


Select Software Updates under the Help menu.

Click the Available Software tab
Choose the following add-ons:
* Subversive SVN Integration for the Mylyn Project
* Subversive SVN Team Provider
* Subversive SVN Team Provider Localization

Then you need to install the Subversive SVN Connectors.

Click the Add Site button, and enter the following URL:
http://www.polarion.org/projects/subversive/download/eclipse/2.0/update-site/

Then choose the following Add-ons:
* SVNKit 1.2.0 Implementation
* Subversive SVN Connectors



After doing this, you can check out the project with Eclipse, or use the
Team -> Share Project option to configure a project that has already
been imported into Eclipse.



Ant
